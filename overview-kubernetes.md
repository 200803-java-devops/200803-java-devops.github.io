## Overview
- [x] Orchestration
  - The Idea of monitering, managing, and otherwise coordinating Computer Systems(like containors, for instance). There exists a few services which do this and Kubernetes focuses on Container Orchestration (and, fortunately, works well with Docker) and focuses on the deployment, scaling, and general management of software applications.
