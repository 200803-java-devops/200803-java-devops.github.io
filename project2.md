# Project 2
Build a DevOps CI/CD pipeline and orchestration of containerized & cloud-hosted infrastructure. Deploy 2 or more applications onto a Kubernetes cluster through an automated process beginning with a GitHub event triggering a build on a build server, delivery to a build/artifact repository, tests on a test server, and deployment to a production server. Report success or failure to all developers automatically.
