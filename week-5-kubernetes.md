# Week 5 - Kubernetes
## Concepts

- Kubernetes:
    - Architecture:
        - clusters
        - nodes
        - pods
        - services
        - volumes
    - Controllers:
        - Deployments
        - ReplicaSets
    - Objects:
        - names
        - namespaces
        - labels
        - selectors
    - YAML:
        - Configuration
        - deployment files
    - Load balancing
    - Master node control layer
    - kubectl
    - Kubernetes Dashboard
    - Security
    - Networking:
        - ingress/egress rules
    - Scheduling
    - Monitoring

## Questions
- How do you spell k8s?
  - 'k' 'u' 'b' 'e' 'r' 'n' 'e' 't' 'e' 's'.
- Why should we use Kubernetes? What are some benefits of Orchestration?
- What role does the Master and a (worker) node have in a Kubernetes cluster?
- What are some ways to create a Deployment in Kubernetes?
- How can two containers in the same Pod communicate? What about two Pods on the same node? What about two Pods on different nodes?
- Why would you typically use a Deployment over explicitly creating ReplicaSets?
